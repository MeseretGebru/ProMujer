## Who we are?
Pro Mujer was founded in 1990 in El Alto, Bolivia, by two visionary leaders, Lynne Patterson and Carmen Velasco, who believed that given the right opportunities, women can become powerful agents of change.

From a pioneering experiment in micro-lending, Pro Mujer has become one of Latin America’s leading women’s development organizations. Our integrated approach offers access to finance, health and educational services. These are delivered in supportive social spaces that foster community building and equip them with education and tools to take on the challenges they face daily.
