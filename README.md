## Who we are

Pro Mujer was founded in 1990 in El Alto, Bolivia, by two visionary leaders, Lynne Patterson and Carmen Velasco, who believed that given the right opportunities, women can become powerful agents of change.

From a pioneering experiment in micro-lending, Pro Mujer has become one of Latin America’s leading women’s development organizations. Our integrated approach offers access to finance, health and educational services. These are delivered in supportive social spaces that foster community building and equip them with education and tools to take on the challenges they face daily.

## Problem

Access to data is critical for the success of your business. Easily accessible data enables you to move quickly, focus on the product, and build a data-informed culture where data leads to better decisions and action.

74% of businesses say they wan to be data-driven, but only 29% say they are good at connecting analytics to action. If you can’t quickly and easily get actionable insights from your data, unite your company around that insight, and make product or business decisions from it, then you aren’t data-driven.

## The Hypothesis

Companies want to find the way to access their data from everywhere in a easy and safe way. Data become information when you can make decisions from it. 

## Solution

“Pro mujer” app is going to solve the accessibility of the information and this is going to help manager to make decision from their own data. In order to reach this target we need the next steps:
